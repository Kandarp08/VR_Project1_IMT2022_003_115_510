# Methodology

## 1. Part A
Part A focuses on face mask detection using Handcrafted Features and ML Classifiers. The approach involves these key steps:

1. **Feature Extraction:**
   * HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients): Captures the structure and gradient information of an image, making it useful for detecting object shapes and edges.

   * LBP (Local Binary Patterns): LBP is a texture descriptor that works by comparing neighbouring pixels and creating a binary pattern.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Extracts features from both categories.
   * The extracted features are standardized using `StandardScaler` before training the classifiers.
   * Spilts the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).
  
3. **Training Machine Learning Models:**
   * `Support Vector Machine(SVM)`: Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with `C=10`.
   * `Random Forest(RF)`: 200 trees, `max_depth=20`, and class balancing.  
   * `Neural Network Model`:  A simple feedforward network with ReLU activations, dropout, and sigmoid activation for binary classification.  

4. **Evaluation:**
   * `SVM`

## 2. Part B

Part B focuses on face mask detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  The approach involves these key steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    *   A custom `FaceMaskDataset` class (PyTorch Dataset) is created to handle loading images and their corresponding labels ("with_mask" or "without_mask").
    *   Images are loaded using OpenCV (cv2), converted from BGR to RGB color space, and resized to a consistent size of 128x128 pixels.
    *   Data augmentation is applied using `torchvision.transforms`:
        *   `RandomHorizontalFlip`: Randomly flips images horizontally.
        *   `RandomRotation(20)`: Randomly rotates images by up to 20 degrees.
        *  `Normalize`: Normalizes the pixel values using pre-calculated mean and standard deviation values (`[0.5748376, 0.49752444, 0.46703878]` and `[0.25625145, 0.24203679, 0.23397043]`, respectively).
    *   The dataset is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets using `torch.utils.data.random_split`.
    *   PyTorch `DataLoader`s are used to create batches of data for training and validation. The batch size can be configured such that the model fits into VRAM.

2.  **Model Definition (CNN):**
    *   A flexible CNN architecture is defined using PyTorch's `nn.Module`.
    *   `ConvBlock`:  A reusable convolutional block is defined, comprising a convolutional layer (`nn.Conv2d`), optional batch normalization (`nn.BatchNorm2d`), an activation function (ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU, Tanh, or Sigmoid), and an optional pooling layer (Max or Average Pooling).
    *   `CNN`:  The main CNN class is highly configurable:
        *   `in_channels`: Number of input channels (3 for RGB images).
        *   `num_classes`: Number of output classes (2 for "with_mask" and "without_mask").
        *   `conv_channels`:  A list specifying the number of output channels for *each* convolutional layer.
        *   `kernel_sizes`, `pool_types`, `pool_sizes`, `activations`: Lists specifying the parameters for each convolutional block.  The `_extend_param` method ensures these lists are the correct length, repeating the last element if necessary.
        *   `use_batch_norm`:  A boolean flag to enable/disable batch normalization.
        *   `fc_sizes`: A list specifying the sizes of the fully connected layers.
        *   `dropout_rates`:  A list of dropout rates for the fully connected layers.
        *   `final_pool_size`:  The output size of the adaptive average pooling layer (`nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d`) before the fully connected layers. This makes the network less sensitive to the input image size.
    *   The model architecture consists of a sequence of `ConvBlock`s, followed by adaptive average pooling, flattening, and then a series of fully connected layers with dropout and the specified activation functions.  The final layer has `num_classes` output units.

3.  **Training:**
    *   The `train_model` function handles the training loop:
        *   Device Selection:  Uses CUDA (GPU) if available, otherwise falls back to CPU.
        *   Optimizer: Supports Adam, AdamW, and SGD optimizers.
        *   Epochs and Batches: Iterates through epochs and batches of training data.
        *   Forward and Backward Pass:  Calculates predictions, loss, performs backpropagation, and updates model weights.
        *   Progress Bar (tqdm):  Displays a progress bar with training loss and accuracy.
        *   Validation:  Evaluates the model on the validation set after each epoch, calculating validation loss and accuracy.
        *   Metric Logging: Stores training/validation loss and accuracy for later plotting.

4.  **Evaluation:**
    *   The `train_model` function returns both the trained model and a dictionary containing the training history (losses and accuracies).  This history is used to plot learning curves.

## 3. Part C

For this task, the first 500 images inside the folder <b>MSFD/1/face_crop</b> were segmented. To segment each image, the following steps were carried out:

1. Convert the image to grayscale.
2. Apply a Gaussian filter of size <b>3x3</b> with a standard deviation of <b>0.5</b> on the grayscale image to remove any noise present.
3. Apply Canny edge detection on the  smoothed out image. The thresholds used were <b>20</b> and <b>100</b>.
4. After finding the edges, contours of the edges were found. Next, the bounding boxes were computed for each contour.
5. Initialize two images <b>segmented_image1</b> and <b>segmented_image2</b> to be completely black. One of these is chosen to be the final output. Then iterate through the bounding box for each contour and do: <br>
(a) Apply binary and inverse binary thresholding on the corresponding part of the blurred grayscale image. Otsu thresholding method was chosen to adapt to different types of images. <br>
(b) Add one image to <b>segmented_image1</b> and the other to <b>segmented_image2</b>.
6. For both the segmented images, make the <b>top 60%</b> of the image as black. 
7. The image which has a greater number of white pixels is chosen to be the segmented image. The same is saved in <b>Output/PartC</b>.
8. The IoU score is calculated using the ground truth segmented output given in the <b>MSFD/1/face_crop_segmentation</b> folder.

## 4. Part D

The core of Part D focuses on semantic segmentation of face masks in images using a U-Net model.  The steps involved are:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    *   The `MSFDDataset` class handles loading image-segmentation pairs, resizing them to a consistent size (128x128), converting them to PyTorch tensors, and applying normalization to the image data.
    *   DataLoaders are created for both training and validation sets to feed data to the model during training.

2.  **Model Definition (U-Net):**
    *   A flexible U-Net architecture (`UNet` class) is implemented.  This allows for configurable depth, base filter count, activation function (ReLU, LeakyReLU, or ELU), batch normalization, and dropout.
    *   The U-Net consists of an encoding path (contracting) and a decoding path (expanding) with skip connections.
    *   The encoding path downsamples the input image through convolutional blocks and max pooling, capturing features at different scales.
    *   The decoding path upsamples the feature maps using transposed convolutions and concatenates them with corresponding feature maps from the encoding path (skip connections).
    *   A final 1x1 convolution maps the output to the number of segmentation classes (256 in this case, representing pixel intensity levels in the grayscale masks).

3.  **Training:**
    *   The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and Cross-Entropy loss.
    *   The `train_model` function performs the training loop:
        *   Iterates through epochs.
        *   For each epoch, iterates through batches of training data.
        *   Performs forward pass, calculates loss, performs backward pass, and updates model weights.
        *   Calculates and logs training loss.
        *   Evaluates the model on the validation set after each epoch.
        *   Calculates and logs validation loss, accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice score.

4.  **Evaluation:**
    *   The trained model is evaluated on the validation set.
    *   Key metrics:
        *   **Validation Loss:** Measures the model's error on the validation set.
        *   **Validation Accuracy:**  The percentage of correctly classified pixels.
        *   **Validation IoU (Intersection over Union):** Measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth masks.
        *   **Validation Dice Score:**  Another measure of overlap, similar to IoU but more sensitive to differences in mask size.

5.  **Prediction and Visualization:**
    * The `create_prediction_grid` function displays a grid of images, predicted segmentation masks (overlaid on the images), and ground truth masks (overlaid on the images) for visual assessment.

# Hyperparameters and Experiments

<br>
https://wandb.ai/ritishtest1/face-mask-detection-vr-mini-project-1/sweeps/uo9mdr7h

The provided parallel coordinates plot and line graphs illustrate the results of hyperparameter optimization. The key hyperparameters explored were:

* **`activations`**:  Activation function used in the convolutional and fully connected layers (`relu`, `leaky_relu`, `elu`, `y_relu`).
* **`batch_size`**: Batch size for training and validation data loaders (ranging from approximately 10 to 130). The shown experiments were run with a value of 128.
* **`conv_channels`**:  Number of output channels for each convolutional layer.
* **`dropout_rates`**:  Dropout rates for the fully connected layers (0, 0.3, 0.5).
* **`fc_sizes`**:  Sizes of the fully connected layers (various combinations).
* **`use_batch_norm`**: Boolean flag to enable/disable batch normalization (True/False).  `True` (enabled) was chosen for the best model.
* **`optimizer`**: Choice of optimizer (`adam`, `adamw`). `adamw` was selected.
* **`learning_rate`**: Learning rate for the optimizer (ranging from approximately 0.001 to 0.009). The best performing runs were around a learning rate of 0.001.

The parallel coordinate plot, particularly the lines colored in the yellow/orange range (corresponding with higher val_accuracy), indicates optimal value ranges for these hyperparameters.

## 2. Part D

Hyperparameter sweep:
<br>
https://wandb.ai/ritishtest1/masked-face-segmentation/sweeps/yepv6uvq

Based on the provided parallel coordinates plot, several hyperparameter configurations were explored for the U-Net model. The most relevant parameters and their ranges are:

*   **`use_batchnorm`:**  Boolean (True/False). Indicates whether batch normalization is used in the convolutional blocks.  `True` led to significantly better performance.
*   **`learning_rate`:**  Float (ranging from approximately 0.0025 to 0.009). Controls the step size during optimization.  Values less than 0.0085 seem optimal based on the parallel coordinates plot.
*   **`filters_base`:** Integer (16/32/64).  Determines the number of filters in the first convolutional layer. Higher values generally performed better.
*   **`depth`:** Integer (ranging from 2 to 4).  Represents the depth of the U-Net (number of encoder/decoder blocks). A higher depth is negatively correlated with validation accuracy suggesting overfitting.
*   **`dropout_rate`**: A value between 0 and 0.13. The experiments show that a lower dropout rate leads to higher val_accuracy.

The parallel coordinates plot shows the relationships between these hyperparameters and the `val_accuracy`.  The lines colored closer to yellow/orange indicate higher validation accuracy.  From the plot, the best performing configurations tend to have:

*   `use_batchnorm`: True
*   `learning_rate`:  Less than 0.008
*   `filters_base`:  32 or 64
*   `depth`: 3 or 4
*   `dropout_rate`: Close to 0

## 5. Comparing ML Classifiers with CNN

**Feature Extraction:**

*   **ML Classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, NN):**  These classifiers relied on hand-engineered features extracted using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). These methods are designed to capture shape and texture information.
*   **CNN:** The CNN learned relevant features directly from the image data through its convolutional layers. This eliminates the need for manual feature engineering.

**Performance Comparison:**

The CNN model exhibited slightly better performance, achieving a validation accuracy of about 97% with the best hyperparameters. The traditional ML classifiers, SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network, reached accuracies of 94.26%, 92.31%, and 93.16% respectively. The CNN's ability to automatically learn relevant features allowed it to outperform the ML classifiers that relied on hand-engineered features.

**Advantages and Disadvantages:**

| Feature                       | ML Classifiers (SVM, RF, NN)                                                              | CNN                                                                                                                                          |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature Engineering           | Requires manual feature extraction (HOG, LBP).  This can be time-consuming and may not capture all relevant information.  Feature quality is crucial. | Learns features automatically from data.  No manual intervention needed. Can adapt to specific nuances of the dataset.                             |
| Feature Representation        | Feature representation limited by the design and effectiveness of HOG and LBP.                 | Can learn complex, hierarchical feature representations that are tailored to the classification task.                                      |
| Generalization              | Potentially limited generalization if hand-engineered features are not robust to variations. | Better generalization due to the ability to learn robust features and adapt to variations in the data.                                    |
| Computational Complexity      | Lower computational complexity for training with a small number of data points.                 | Higher computational complexity, especially during training, due to the large number of parameters in the network.                          |
| Data Requirements           | Can perform reasonably well with smaller datasets, as feature engineering reduces complexity.  | Requires a larger amount of training data to learn effective features and prevent overfitting.                                                |
| Architecture Design         | A relatively simple model, so easier to design. | A very complex model so requires a detailed knowledge to build this correctly. |

**Conclusion:**

The CNN generally exhibits superior performance compared to traditional ML classifiers because it automatically learns relevant features from the raw image data. The ML classifiers, being limited by the human engineering for the features and the complexity of models, perform slightly worse. The main difference between a good CNN model and good ML models is that the machine automatically learn the relevant features.

## 6. Comparing Traditional segmentation techniques with U-Net

**Traditional Segmentation:**

Looking at the provided images, we can make the following observations about the *traditional segmentation* results:

*   **Inconsistent Mask Boundaries:**  The edges of the segmented masks are often jagged and do not accurately follow the true boundaries of the face masks.  In many cases, parts of the face (forehead, chin, cheeks) are incorrectly included in the mask region, or parts of the mask are excluded.
*   **Sensitivity to Background/Foreground:** The segmentation appears to be heavily influenced by contrast differences.  Areas of the image that are bright (like writing on a shirt or a light reflection) are sometimes incorrectly classified as part of the mask. Conversely, darker regions within the mask itself (shadows, folds) can be missed.
*   **"Holes" and Fragments:** There are often "holes" within the segmented mask, where parts of the mask are incorrectly classified as background. There are also disconnected fragments of the mask region, showing failure of the segmentation method.
*   **Top Section Blacked Out:** The top portion of all segmented images is completely black, indicating a post-processing step to remove parts of the image that were consistently misclassified.  This shows that these parts could not be fixed, and were hence set to black.

**U-Net Segmentation:**

In contrast to the traditional method, the U-Net segmentation (based on previous descriptions and the known good metrics) exhibits the following characteristics:

*   **Accurate Boundaries:** The U-Net is able to learn the complex shapes of the masks and accurately delineate their boundaries, even in the presence of variations in lighting, mask color, and facial features.
*   **Robustness:** The U-Net is much less sensitive to variations in contrast and lighting. It is able to correctly identify the mask region even when there are shadows or bright spots.
*   **Completeness:**  The U-Net produces complete, connected mask regions without holes or spurious fragments.
*   **No Heuristics:** The U-Net achieves good results without requiring hand-crafted heuristics or post-processing steps like blacking out portions of the image.

# Observations and Analysis

## CNN (Part B)

**Observations:**

*   **High Accuracy Achieved:** After hyperparameter optimization, the best model achieved a validation accuracy of 97%.
*   **Consistent Training & Validation:** Good training and validation accuracies indicated no overfitting and generalization was successful.

**Analysis:**

The optimized CNN model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between images with and without masks. This suggests that the chosen architecture and optimized hyperparameters allowed the model to effectively learn discriminating features within the images. The strong consistency between training and validation performance indicates the model generalizes well to unseen data. The relatively simple task did not demand a very complex neural network.

## Traditional Segmentation (Part C)

**Challenges faced:** 

* Most of the images have edges in the face, and inside the mask region as well. This causes many unnecessary edges to be detected.

* Segmentation on some images resulted in the face being segmented, while the mask region was segmented as background. This was causing a drastic reduction in the average IoU.

**Methods used:**

* To remove unnecessary edges, blurring was done using a Gaussian fileter. However, too much blurring caused the edges near the mask to not be detected.

* To overcome the second problem, two sets of segmented images were generated, as mentioned in the methodology. The segmented image with a greater number of white pixels in the lower region of the image was considered better. This is why both binary as well inverse binary thresholding were performed.


## U-Net (Part D)

**Observations:**

*   **Strong Metric Performance:** A high validation accuracy, Dice, and IoU scores, representing a good segmentation of the masks in the image.
*   **Clear Visual Agreement:** Visual inspection of prediction grids reveal that predicted masks agree closely with ground truth masks.

**Analysis:**

The high validation metrics on the U-Net indicates effective learning of the segmentation task. Visual inspection of results also indicates good model performance, meaning it is doing a reasonable job of classifying pixels. The strong performance suggests the U-Net architecture is appropriate for the task and can learn mask features effectively.
